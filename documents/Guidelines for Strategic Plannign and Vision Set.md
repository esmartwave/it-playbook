### KEY POINT #1: Conduct your planing within your scope; do not plan for others.

One of my key learnings around strategic planning is: **it is easy for strategic plans to extend beyond their needed scope**, e.g. seeing the broader potential in people, teams and products rather than constraining within the limits of a team's purpose. It is also easy to allow the scope of a plan to surpass its defined boundaries, e.g. building a strategic plan for a department that surpasses the vision/expectations of the company. In safe, defined environments these exercises can stretch the boundaries of what is into truly innovative and disruptive spaces. However, when leading a team, being disruptive to your organization can lead to misalignment of strategic vision and ultimate leadership failure. 

### KEY POINT #2: Don't create Inspiration Statements that only are aligned to your team.

Another key learning has been this: when your company your company does not already have the Inspirational Statements outlined, defining them for your team is a risk that might pay off but often results in ultimate leadership failure. If your company does not have Inspirational Statements defined, propose them to your executive team and get sign-off. Once the executive team/board has signed off on Inspirational statementsoneWhen a cmopany does not have a 10-year plan, don't invent one with your team; propose one for your company and get teh executive team to sign off. This rule applies to any of the Inspirational Statements outlined, along with a Roadmap. 

### KEY POINT #3: Roadmaps should be approved by your executive leader and/or team.

Final point and key laerning of mine: roadmaps need executive approval. Getting this approval allows you to showcase your vision and approach, and also allows you to get feedback from the executive team if you and they are aligned on expectations for the business, your team and you. If the copmany does not have a defined roadmap, propose your ideas and seek active feedback to align and do not get attached to the items as some of them may be adjusted, altered or ignored.
