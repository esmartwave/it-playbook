# Communications Template for IT Teams to Users

### General Tips

The biggest challenge IT Operations teams face in terms of change is managing the behavioral and emotional change that comes with making technical or process changes. Technology and process changes are left brain and logical, and easy to understand. However, changing someone's work can have an emotional impact on people; they may perceive the change, which they may not know the logic behind or understand the reasoning (or we cannot tell them), to be erroneous and adding more to their workload, which is already significant. Individuals can also perceive these changes as disruptive, which they often are. 

*The key to a good change rollout is good communications; provide just enough information on why, what and how the change will impact them, and happiness/adoption rates will climb.*

* Inform
* Reduce anxiety
* Reduce harmful speculation
* Take useful action

_SPECIAL NOTE: Highly technical user groups are often skeptical of IT and Security teams sending changes. For Engineering or other highly technical teams, make sure they are informed of the change prior to the first change notice going out to the company._

## Notice of Single Change / Announcement of Change

These common notices can be for any single event, from an app update, to a change in process or a newly available resource. Keep it short. Keep it specific. Keep it light.

_**OUTLINE**_

* What is changing
* When it is changing
* Why is this changing
* What does the user have to do
* What changes should the user expect
* What to do if the user runs into problems

## Rollouts / Changes to Key Systems

Big efforts require more communication up front to give people time to plan, adapt and ask questions/voice concerns. The more we help people navigate the anxiety and potential disruption from change, the happier people will be!

### Suggested Cadence and Topic for Each Communication

* Talk to Heads of Teams to Confirm Dates and Plan
* Send a notice as early as you can that is informational
* Send a scond notice detailing the schedule and actions required
* Send a reminder of actions required and the schedule, target actions (if you can) to folks that have not completed the action
* Remind impacted folks the change is happening
* Send all stakeholders an after action summary

#### Example Outline - Initial Notice, Send Well Ahead of Change

* <follow the Ad-hoc template>

#### Example Outline - Second Notice, Sent 1-2 Weeks Ahead of Change

* <follow the Ad-hoc template> 

#### Example Outline - Third Notice, Sent Prior to Change

* One paragraph reminder of the event
* Where resources/support can be found

#### Example Outline - Fourth Notice, Sent Day of Change

* Notification the change is starting
* How long to expect the change to take

#### Example Outline - After Action Summary

* Thank everyone
* What happened
* Why we did it
* What went well
* What we learned
* Support information reminder

## Emergencies / Incidents

Minimally Viable Information: Share the least amount of information necessary during an incident, but inform and provide specifics so people DON'T PANIC.

* What is impacted
* Who is impacted
* What is the status
* When can they expect restoration of service

### Example 

Our key printing system is currently offline in buildings 3, 4 and 5. This outage is impacting all team members attempting to print to devices in those buildings. We are currently investigating the cause, and do not yet have an estimated time to resolve.
