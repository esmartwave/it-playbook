# Communications Template for IT Teams to Users

### General Tips

The biggest challenge IT Operations teams face in terms of change is managing the behavioral and emotional change that comes with making technical or process changes. Technology and process changes are left brain and logical, and easy to understand. However, changing someone's work can have an emotional impact on people; they may perceive the change, which they may not know the logic behind or understand the reasoning (or we cannot tell them), to be erroneous and adding more to their workload, which is already significant. Individuals can also perceive these changes as disruptive, which they often are. 

*The key to a good change rollout is good communications; provide just enough information on why, what and how the change will impact them, and happiness/adoption rates will climb.*

* Inform
* Reduce anxiety
* Reduce harmful speculation
* Take useful action

_SPECIAL NOTE: Highly technical user groups are often skeptical of IT and Security teams sending changes. For Engineering or other highly technical teams, make sure they are informed of the change prior to the first change notice going out to the company._

## Notice of Single Change / Announcement of Change

These common notices can be for any single event, from an app update, to a change in process or a newly available resource.

* Talk to Heads of Teams to Confirm Dates and Plan

* Fifth Notice, after change report

### Example

Keep it short. Keep it specific. Keep it light. 

## Emergencies / Incidents

Minimally Viable Information: Share the least amount of information necessary during an incident, but inform and provide specifics so people DON'T PANIC.
