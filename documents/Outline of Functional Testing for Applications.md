# Outline of Functional Testing for Applications

## Outline 
Defining functional tests for applications or processes is a meaningful way to ensure your plan or design goes through simulated stress testing. A good design should hold up against pressures from various angles, and if it does not, I put on my "engineer hat" and assess the weak points and how to mitigate them, re-think parts of my design or start over.

**Bold items that are needed to complete basic needs.** Do not bold items that would improve efficiency, unless efficiency is the objective of the project.

This document pairs well with "Evaluating Software for Solutions Template".

### Descriptions of terms

* **Testable Scenarios** - A specific scenario that describes a sitaution and specific actions that will be taken, with a desired outcome.
* **Functional Use Cases / Features** - A specific task that needs to be performed with a desired result, often expressed as "PersonX needs to PerformY function to AccomplishResultZ." Features may also be expressed as clearly defined, repeatable actions that do not have a specific result. 
* **Non-functional tests** - These are test scenario parameters, such as volume, load or situations where there will be reduced capacity or ability to operate.

### Personas

## STATEMENTS

There are multiple statements that can be useful for testing, but a good guide for tests is they should:

* Validate that your inputs can be accepted
* Determine if the expected output(s) will be produced
* Illuminate any gaps or errors in the flow of information
* Identify performance issues related to load/capacity/throughput/scalability
* Confirm that needed tasks/scenarios can be performed to a desired outcome
* Produce outcome(s) acceptable to the business process/system owner
