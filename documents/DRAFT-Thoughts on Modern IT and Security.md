# DRAFT-Thoughts on Modern IT and Security Programs

## Overview

All small and/or growing organizations struggle with how to optimally implement and organize IT functions. Part of this challenge is due to outmoded thinking about IT as a purely technical function. In a modern company, technology is an operational function that drives efficiency, supports effectiveness and helps drive greater value to business operations, products and services. The modern (v4) IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) list more than 30 process and methodologies, ranging from general management and service management to technical management and covering a wide range of processes. 

## What is the purpose of Information Technology & Security

A modern IT and Security teamâ€™s purpose is to set up individuals and teams to be self-sufficient, maximizing their ability to deliver outcomes in their focus area while enforcing guardrails that prevent behaviors outside of risk tolerances identified by the executive team and board of directors. This is achieved by having four distinct areas integrated: Business Operations, Information Technology, Information Security and Business Applications.

### Business Operations / Operational Program Management

The purpose of Business Operations is to encourage effective management of knowledge, service requests and continuous improvement of business processes to drive greater team and process efficiency. A primarily non-technical area, Business Operations must have technical capabilities to understand how technology works and how it integrates, in order to provide front-line support and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, Business Operations must execute on tactical functions, such as:

* Onboarding
* Offboarding 
* Third Party Vendor Management
* Procurement
* Change Enablement / Management
* Knowledge Management
* Service Desk / Service Level Management


### Information Technology

### Information Systems / Business Applications

### Security
