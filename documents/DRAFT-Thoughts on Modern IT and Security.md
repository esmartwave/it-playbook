# DRAFT-Thoughts on Modern IT and Security Programs

## Overview

All small and/or growing organizations struggle with how to optimally implement and organize IT functions. Part of this challenge is due to outmoded thinking about IT as a purely technical function. In a modern company, technology is an operational function that drives efficiency, supports effectiveness and helps drive greater value to business operations, products and services. The modern (v4) IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) list more than 30 process and methodologies, ranging from general management and service management to technical management and covering a wide range of processes. 

## What is the purpose of Information Technology & Security

A modern IT and Security team’s purpose is to set up individuals and teams to be self-sufficient, maximizing their ability to deliver outcomes in their focus area while enforcing guardrails that prevent behaviors outside of risk tolerances identified by the executive team and board of directors. This is achieved by having four distinct areas integrated: Business Operations, Information Technology, Information Security and Business Applications.

### Business Operations / Operational Program Management

The purpose of Business Operations is to encourage effective management of knowledge, service requests and continuous improvement of business processes to drive greater team and process efficiency. A primarily non-technical area, Business Operations must have technical capabilities to understand how technology works and how it integrates, in order to provide front-line support and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, Business Operations must execute on tactical functions, such as:

* Onboarding
* Offboarding 
* Third Party Vendor Management
* Procurement
* Change Enablement / Management
* Knowledge Management
* Service Desk / Service Level Management

### Information Technology / Business Technology

The purpose of Information Technology is to enable technical and non-technical individuals to focus on their primary area of work by supporting, managing and administering technology and infrastructure that supports the business. A primarily technical team, IT must be able to navigate user requests and complex requests from technical teams including Security, Engineering and Business Applications. IT focuses on executing on tactical functions, indicated below, and also supporting technical teams with their focus areas as well.

* Level 1 Technical Troubleshooting
* Level 2 Administration of Systems “owned” by IT, Security
* Infrastructure and Platform Management
* Problem Management
* Configuration Management
* Asset Management

### Information Systems / Business Applications

The purpose of Information Technology is to enable technical and non-technical individuals to focus on their primary area of work by supporting, managing and administering technology and infrastructure that supports the business. A primarily technical team, IT must be able to navigate user requests and complex requests from technical teams including Security, Engineering and Business Applications. IT focuses on executing on tactical functions, indicated below, and also supporting technical teams with their focus areas as well.

* Business Analysis
* Enterprise Business System Administration
* Business Application Release and Deployment Management
* Business Application Software Development and Management

### Security

The purpose of Information Technology is, simply put, management of risk related to the governance, access to and use of information and technology. A strong security team will consider risks from multiple angles; not just from outside threats but also the risk that comes from excess security that does not support the business’ goals. Information Security is primarily a technical team that relies on IT and Business Operations for support, and collaborates heavily with other technical and non-technical teams. This team must balance technical know-how with a strong understanding of the business, our customers and our products. Security focuses on executing 

* Governance of compliance to frameworks e.g. ISO and SOC 2
* Information Security Management
* Security Reviews
* Risk Assessments
* Monitoring and Event Management
* Access Management
* Incident Management
* Risk Management
