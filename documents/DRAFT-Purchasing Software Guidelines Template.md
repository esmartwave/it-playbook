## Process
Classify the solution
Define your selection criteria
Conduct walkthroughs (not demos) to showcase each selection criteria
Rank each solutions ability to deliver to the criteria
Use the mathematical score to inform your decisions

## Classifying the Solution
Putting every request through a full review would be cumbersome, inefficient and annoying for everyone involved, unless your organization has such tight spending controls that you need to do this. The first question to answer is: "How much risk does this solution pose to my organization?"
Much like any other risk matrix, there is a simple outline for this to make a quick decision about the rigor needed. This template will suggest some ideas, but you will need to determine how you want to handle the levels of risk and how you will determine those levels.
I suggest considering these factors:
Scope - The number of your users that will be impacted
Data Classification - The type of information this solution will hold/interact with, and therefore the controls that are required
Cost - Setting a limit at which you will conduct a full or partial review

## Defining the Factors
Scope
Enterprise-Wide - Solution will be used by more than two divisions or more than 40% of the organization.
Cross-Department - Solution will be used by multiple departments in a single division or across divisions.
Single Team/Individual - Solution will be used by a single team, typically less than 5 people, or a single individual.
Classification
These are common terms used in corporate information security, but for reference they tend to mean:
Protected - This type of information is typically customer data; the type of information that, if leaked out, would seriously damage your organization or your customers.
Confidential - This type of information typically includes all trade secrets, company confidential information and employee data, including personally identifiable information.
Internal - This information would include basic process documents or guides; information that is internal to your organization but would not be damaging if it were leaked.
Public - Information readily available to the public.
Cost
Each organization must define its own levels, but I recommend the following, and would adjust based on your total revenue or G&A spend:
Large Solution - Any solution that incurs more than $25,000/yr in recurring costs or more than $40,000 in one-time cost.
Medium Solution - Any solution that incurs between $5,000/year and $25,000/yr in recurring costs, or less than $40,000 in one-time cost.
Small Solution - Any solution that incurs less than $5,000/year in recurring costs, or less than $15,000 in one-time cost.

Outline of Process
Produce a use case, receive budget approval, proceed with procurement review
Submit selection criteria, receive budget approval, proceed with procurement review
Selection criteria will be collected before a budget number is defined; budget approval must be granted before procurement review
Functional Review
List a reasonable use case and include it in your request. Any current solutions that match this use case will be recommended for review.
Using our defined template, present the criteria you used to evaluate and the results of your evaluation upon submission. Any current solutions that match supplied criteria that were not considered will be reviewed before proceeding with procurement. Any unmet security criteria will be re-reviewed.
Using our defined template, IT will work with stakeholders to define selection criteria, evaluate against our existing solutions and conduct reviews of new tools with stakeholders

SUGGESTIONS
Evaluate 2-3 external solutions, even if your internal solution is ranked highly
Require walkthroughs with solutions engineers, not standard demos/slides; make them show how it will meet your criteria
send your criteria ahead of the walkthrough; your vendors will thank you!
Make sure you have all license options outlined, and all of your key criteria are met
If you have an existing contract, don't sign an MNDA; it may supercede your existing agreement
Always conduct basic due diligence on software - sub processors and vendors are common source of breaches and data leaks
Requirements Descriptions
Cost Trigger - Does your organization want to initiate a more rigorous review for larger purchases?
Scope Trigger - Do you want a more rigorous process if the solution will be used by most of the organization?
Data Classification Trigger - Do you want a more rigorous process if the solution will interact with classified information?
Outline of Process - A general outline of your process, high level.
Functional Review - Who will do the review, and what will they provide?
IT-led review must occur - Do you want to require a specific team to do a more rigorous review?
Single Sign On - Single Sign On is a great way to control access to systems while making it easier for authorized people to access a system.
Auto-provisioning requirement - If enough users will be in the system, auto-provisioning can save time for teams and IT to manage users.
Security Requirement - Any specific security requirements you may have.
Solution Budget Will be Owned By - If you want certain "sizes" of solutions to be owned by IT or some specific Business Apps team, this is a good place to define that team.
