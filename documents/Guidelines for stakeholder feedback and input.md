# Guidelines for stakeholder feedback and input

## What are the benefits of using these guidelines?

Stakeholder input and feedback is useful for nearly any kind of effort. Any type of effort is attempting to "do something", and often the desired result is some form of "adding value", "improvement" or "result". The question is: how do you know if you added value, improved something or achieved your desired result? While a number of measures can be used one of the most useful is direct feedback from your audience (internal customers, external customers, partners). 

Gaining feedback, and regular feedbck from your stakeholders is a fundamental prinicpal of lean, agile and other modern product practices. Without input and regular feedback, it becomes exponentially risky and costly to deliver desired results at high speed. 

### How often should input or feedback be sought? 

As often as is needed, but generally speaking input is a means to reduce risk; gaining a good amount of up-front input can help improve the sucess of a project, but trying to get all points of input from all stakeholders might increase risk by delaying the effort.

The balance to strike is getting _just enough_ input from _just enough_ stakeholders to guide the effort accurately, while not seeking more input than is needed and therefore creating delays.
