# Memo for Risk Appetite and Tolerance Template

### Quick notes for reference

* Appetite = overall acceptance
* Tolerance = how much risk can be tolerated for each item
* What controls are required to stay under tolerance and near acceptance?

ex. For safety, car speed limit is 55 (acceptance), but tickets aren't given until 10+ over that (tolerance). Tickets, fines, license status, signs are all controls. 

### Group your topics/risk

* Accept no risk
* Accept some risk
* Accept more risk

For each risk, assign low, medium or high, possibly represented by a number for better calculations.
