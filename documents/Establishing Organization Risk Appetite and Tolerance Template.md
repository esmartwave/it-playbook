# Establishing Organization Risk Appetite and Tolerance

(1) Acceptable or on-strategy risks that the organization intends to take because the risk taken is sufficiently compensated. These risks are typically foundational elements of the business strategy and are inherent in the organization’s strategy – for example, investing in developing countries to fuel market growth.

(2) Undesirable or off-strategy risks that should be avoided and for which zero/minimal tolerances should be set. These are risks that often require policy prohibitions (e.g., restrictions on the use of financial derivatives for profit-making purposes and the types of instruments used, and minimum criteria for counter-parties). For risks that an organization chooses to avoid, the company may acknowledge them as part of its risk appetite statement to communicate clearly that such risks are unacceptable.

(3) Parameters within which management runs the business. Parameters provide a framework within which a company’s risks are undertaken. They may impact decision-making during the planning cycle and also during the consideration of strategic priorities and the execution of the business plan. Parameters drive discussions between executive management and the Board when unforeseen opportunities arise, providing a framework within which risks may be undertaken. They may be expressed as targets, ranges, floors or ceilings, and may be strategic, financial or operational in nature. For example, strategic parameters include new products to pursue and avoid and the investment pool for capital expenditures and M&A activity. Financial parameters include the maximum acceptable level of loss or performance variation and include EPS variability, FCF growth/margin, EBIT growth/margin, target debt rating, target debt/equity ratio, EBIT/interest coverage ratio and derivative counter-party criteria. Operating parameters include capacity considerations, R&D investment pool, environmental requirements, safety targets, quality targets and customer concentration limits.

Who makes decisions



1. We think we can manage risk by predicting extreme events.
2. We are convinced that studying the past will help us manage risk.
3. We don’t listen to advice about what we shouldn’t do.
4. We assume that risk can be measured by standard deviation.
5. We don’t appreciate that what’s mathematically equivalent isn’t psychologically so.
6. We are taught that efficiency and maximizing shareholder value don’t tolerate redundancy.
