# Establishing Organization Risk Appetite and Tolerance

When considering risk, a good place to start is to think like a board member, investor or CEO. What are the known factors that might put the success, resiliency or viability of the business at risk? The answers to this question will be different based on the stage of the business, the stage of the product, the state of the market and other economic/social/political factors and may even be different from one month to the next. 

The key factor in establishing a risk management approach is to deeply understand the business, product and markets you are in. Once you know those, then identifyL

* the risks you face
* How much risk you are willing to take on that (using "T-shirt" sizes here is good enough)
* How much of each risk you are willing to tolerate (the maximum allowable amount of each risk; this must be a number/metric/measurabl amount)

The common analogy of speed limits to corporate risk management is something I found helpful.

* Speed limits are set to reduce the risk of crashes
* People are more likely to be injured/die during a crash
* Speed limits may vary depending on the climate, road condition, weather and position of the road (mountian pass vs. wide open plain)
* A driver unfamiliar with a stretch of road may not be aware of the risk associated with that part of road
* Speed limits are posted as part of risk management, to inform what the risk appetite is and to notify drivers that higher speeds may result in a higher probability of a crash
* Speed limits are enforced by law enforcement
* A speed limit is set as the "risk appetite" or acceptance; what is the desired speed for to low end of the risk appetite
* A speeding ticket is given when a driver is (typiclaly) 10 miles an hour over the speed limit; this is the risk tolerance (more than 10 miles per hour over the limit is too much risk)
* Persistent violaiton of the tolerance will result in suspension of privileges
* Driving without privileges may result in jail time
* This information is published and widely known, and this information alone has reduced crashes and fatalities 

Below are some ideas to get you and your team thinking about what risks or challenges face your organization and how to start classifying/quantifying them.

## Acceptable Risk

Acceptable or on-strategy risks that the organization intends to take because the risk taken is sufficiently compensated. These risks are typically foundational elements of the business strategy and are inherent in the organization’s strategy – for example, investing in developing countries to fuel market growth.

## Undesirable Risk

Undesirable or off-strategy risks that should be avoided and for which zero/minimal tolerances should be set. These are risks that often require policy prohibitions (e.g., restrictions on the use of financial derivatives for profit-making purposes and the types of instruments used, and minimum criteria for counter-parties). For risks that an organization chooses to avoid, the company may acknowledge them as part of its risk appetite statement to communicate clearly that such risks are unacceptable.

## Common Risks to Run The Business

Parameters within which management runs the business. Parameters provide a framework within which a company’s risks are undertaken. They may impact decision-making during the planning cycle and also during the consideration of strategic priorities and the execution of the business plan. Parameters drive discussions between executive management and the Board when unforeseen opportunities arise, providing a framework within which risks may be undertaken. They may be expressed as targets, ranges, floors or ceilings, and may be strategic, financial or operational in nature. For example, strategic parameters include new products to pursue and avoid and the investment pool for capital expenditures and M&A activity. Financial parameters include the maximum acceptable level of loss or performance variation and include EPS variability, FCF growth/margin, EBIT growth/margin, target debt rating, target debt/equity ratio, EBIT/interest coverage ratio and derivative counter-party criteria. Operating parameters include capacity considerations, R&D investment pool, environmental requirements, safety targets, quality targets and customer concentration limits.

## Common misconceptions about risk

1. We think we can manage risk by predicting extreme events.
2. We are convinced that studying the past will help us manage risk.
3. We don’t listen to advice about what we shouldn’t do.
4. We assume that risk can be measured by standard deviation.
5. We don’t appreciate that what’s mathematically equivalent isn’t psychologically so.
6. We are taught that efficiency and maximizing shareholder value don’t tolerate redundancy.
7. We are surprised when conditions are ripe to invite excess risk, and the event occurs.
