# Definition of Done Template

## Overview

MATRIX for DONE

Done is not always "Done".

Done is a rainbow!

Requiring a Definition of Done generally means that work is to be completed, and either a change has occurred or a serivce has been delivered.

I am overlaying ITL onto Scrum here.

### Types of Changes

#### FUNCTIONAL

Not "how", but "what you will be doing

Functional Criteria: Identify specific user tasks, functions or business processes that must be in place. A functional criterion might be “A user is able to access a list of available reports.”

#### NON-FUNCTIONAL

A non-functional criterion might be “Edit buttons and Workflow buttons comply with the Site Button Design.”

### Classifications of Work Scopes

#### Project / Epic

A concerted effort over a defined period of time. May have clear objectives.

#### Sprint (reviews)

A focused work effort intended to produce a releaseble set of features. Done is evaluated during the Sprint Reviews.

#### CHANGES

##### Major

Changing data schemas, security settings, integrations, key workflows

##### Minor

Anything that is not Major or pre-authorized.

##### Pre-Authorized

Changes that have an associated standard operating procedure

#### Support

Any fixing of an issue or a problem.
