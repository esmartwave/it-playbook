# Definition of Done Template

## Overview

Definitions of done are a set of paramters defined within an organization or a team that help work teams identify when a collection of work is "completed" or "done". Definine "done" can be highly useful for teams and organizations and can help reduce long-term technical debt by using a checklist that must be completed before moving on to the next work effort. 

In this document, we are defining what done means, but not in singular terms. We will identify recommendations for identifying what "done" means depending on the type of work. WE will attempt to integrate Scrum and ITIL practices.

### Types of Changes

#### FUNCTIONAL

Not "how", but "what you will be doing

Functional Criteria: Identify specific user tasks, functions or business processes that must be in place. A functional criterion might be “A user is able to access a list of available reports.”

#### NON-FUNCTIONAL

A non-functional criterion might be “Edit buttons and Workflow buttons comply with the Site Button Design.”

### Classifications of Work Scopes

#### Project / Epic

A concerted effort over a defined period of time. May have clear objectives.

#### Sprint (reviews)

A focused work effort intended to produce a releaseble set of features. Done is evaluated during the Sprint Reviews.

#### CHANGES

##### Major

Changing data schemas, security settings, integrations, key workflows

##### Minor

Anything that is not Major or pre-authorized.

##### Pre-Authorized

Changes that have an associated standard operating procedure

#### Support

Any fixing of an issue or a problem.
