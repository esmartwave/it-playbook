## Communicating as a part of Share Collaborative {#communicating-as-a-part-of-share-collaborative}

As members of the Share Collaborative, we each make choices in how we interact with others, and those choices may be perceived as a representation of Share Collaborative. The interactions we have may be in person, virtual (via Zoom), asynchronous (someone interacting with a digital recording) or another form of interaction through digital or written methods (letters, emails, Slack, blog posts, social media posts and comments). Any of these methods of interacting may occur when:



* Communicating with other members of Share Collaborative (meetings, Slack, email, training, retreats)
* Communicating with those we serve
* Sharing Share Collaborative’s contributions with the world

### Knowing If Our Communication is Effective {#knowing-if-our-communication-is-effective}



* Upon reflection, did our communication convey the intended message?
* Is the recipient of the communication able to reflect the intended message back?
* How do we feel about what we communicated?
* Is the communication in line with our [core values](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1jy31z6Qq2h4aLjl2QTjMtDoNOrzLuUSPpRgPBCA8CX4/edit) and [guiding principles](#guiding-principles-and-objectives-for-communication)?


### Consider yourself and your audience {#consider-yourself-and-your-audience}



* What is your mindset? Are you present and aware of what might influence your communication?
* How do you feel? Are you in a good place to communicate?
* Who are you communicating with, and are you using an approach that they will receive?
* Are you meeting people with their language, in a way that supports their listening and hearing what you are trying to share?
* Are any “trauma triggers” in play for you or your audience that should be considered?


## Guiding Principles and Objectives for Communication {#guiding-principles-and-objectives-for-communication}

Our actions represent Share Collaborative and our collective purpose. We choose to adopt our [core values](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1jy31z6Qq2h4aLjl2QTjMtDoNOrzLuUSPpRgPBCA8CX4/edit), which help inform how we “show up” to interact with each other and the outside world. The principles outlined here are intended to reinforce our [core values](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1jy31z6Qq2h4aLjl2QTjMtDoNOrzLuUSPpRgPBCA8CX4/edit) and put them in context for communication.


### Communication is an exchange {#communication-is-an-exchange}

Communication is the effective, mutual exchange of meaning or understanding in formal and informal communication. Communication may be directed up, down and sideways, and may also be communicated into and received by people. We choose to treat our communications as an exchange of verbal and non-verbal information in the pursuit of healing and self-mastery. 


### Communicate with Love and Authenticity {#communicate-with-love-and-authenticity}

Journeys to self-mastery are not linear. The path moves as it needs to, sometimes backward, sometimes forward, and sometimes in a brand new direction. We choose to communicate with open hearts, inviting ourselves and others to honor and experience genuine, authentic selves. We choose to support healing for all and encourage transcendence. We choose to use open-ness, love and authenticity as our best methods to build and protect trust. We choose to keep each other and those we serve informed. 


### Consider the power of words and timing {#consider-the-power-of-words-and-timing}



* We are trusted to guide
* Our words have power, and may affect multiple aspects of our audience: 3D (tangible skills and interactions), 4D (emotional intelligence, past and future self) and 5D (spiritual, energetic and ancestral)
* Communicating before an audience is invited (willing) or able (open) to receive may not achieve a desired result


### Consider if the confidentiality of what you want to share {#consider-if-the-confidentiality-of-what-you-want-to-share}

Supporting humans on their journey to self-mastery and guiding teams to a “transcendent workplace” often involves sharing and listening to information shared through moments of vulnerability. We choose to honor those moments and the trust placed in us by considering if our communications respect the trust placed in us and the sacred-ness of sharing vulnerabilities. If we are ever unsure about the level of confidentiality of information we have received, please consult Shawn.


### Information is not communication; consider the needs of our audience(s) {#information-is-not-communication-consider-the-needs-of-our-audience-s}

We have defined a difference between communicating (a mutual exchange) and information (what we share and what others share). We understand that information shared may lack context that is necessary to understand the information and the impact or effect it may have on others. We choose to provide effective communication when sharing information, which may require a conversation, meeting or other two-way interaction to supplement information with discussion or other materials. We chose to consider the needs of various audiences (Share Collaborative members, those we serve, the rest of the world) when planning communication.For example, some audiences may be satisfied with a verbal presentation while others may require one-on-one interaction, and others may be satisfied with a written or recorded format.


### Feedback is essential for healthy growth; encourage it and address quickly {#feedback-is-essential-for-healthy-growth-encourage-it-and-address-quickly}

Transparency, open-ness and representation are core values that govern Share’s operations and strategic direction. In the Holacracy model, feedback is critical information that feeds and fuels the thoughtful evolution of an organization through observation, critical thinking and discussion. We choose to encourage and accept feedback on any topic. We choose to provide feedback to ourselves, each other, those we serve and the world in ways that 



* How to provide feedback
* How Share processes feedback
* Processing feedback expected timeframe
* If the feedback might trigger a response, it is always a good idea to provide time, either during or after feedback is provided, to discuss, ask questions and answer questions
* Mechanisms to provide feedback
* Employees should always be able to say what’s on their minds without retribution, and therefore obtaining feedback and listening effectively are critically important for good communication.
* Effective communication will only come if communicators at all organizational levels seek out feedback and take appropriate action to ensure the intended meaning is passed on to relevant recipients.
* We are always committed to acting on feedback, either with clarifying communication or relevant action.


### Interactions with key contacts at organizations we serve should be coordinated with Shawn {#interactions-with-key-contacts-at-organizations-we-serve-should-be-coordinated-with-shawn}


### Support each other to be effective communicators with training {#support-each-other-to-be-effective-communicators-with-training}

Training in effective communication will always be available to team leaders, supervisors and managers.

Communication materials and support will be provided to managers, supervisors and team leaders as appropriate.


### We communicate wins, celebrations, friction and fails {#we-communicate-wins-celebrations-friction-and-fails}

We are committed to communicating what we do well and what we still need to improve upon quickly, in advance if possible. 



* Rumors in the workplace should be addressed with effective communication as soon as is practicable. 
* Communicating on a “need to know” basis, avoiding controversial issues, or delaying communication “until all details are clear” are contrary to this policy.
