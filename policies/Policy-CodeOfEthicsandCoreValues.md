## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Where We Are Going - First Principles, Vision, Mission, Morals</span> {#where-we-are-going-first-principles-vision-mission-morals}

Our collaborative agrees to guide the governance of the organization using a set of morals and ethical guidelines. The items outlined here do not change frequently as they are foundational to our collaborative’s  code of ethics, guidelines and processes; they shape all of our  collaborative’s actions. 


### Share Collaborative First Principles {#share-collaborative-first-principles}

These statements are more than a declaration of our values; they are truths we believe to be universal. These principles influence our values, guide our work and are a part of our lives.



* All humans are on a journey to self-mastery.

Share Collaborative Vision for Our Shared Future

Our society is egalitarian, full and supportive of past and future generations. All people are supported to be healthful to themselves. Individuals tinker with personal and societal betterment through intentional iteration. Work is play, and through it suffering is relieved. The work of exploring the uncharted possibilities of existence is revered, and ideas are exchanged freely and openly.

Share Collaborative Mission

Guide teams through challenges to reach a “transcendent workplace”, supporting humans to achieve a fully realized existence. 

**_How do we do this?_** Hold space-time and facilitate simplified healing with all facets of an individual’s dimensional identities: 3D (tangible skills and interactions), 4D (emotional intelligence, past and future self) and 5D (spiritual, energetic and ancestral).

## Share’s Code of Ethics and Guiding Principles {#share’s-code-of-ethics-and-guiding-principles}


### Promote **love**  



* Act with love, accept that all are on their journey
* Open your heart to the story of others 
* Remember: love is the real work we are doing, and sometimes it is difficult


### Be **authentic**  {#be-authentic}



* Honor yourself and your journey
* You are unique and a gift
* Bring all of your genuine and authentic self  
* Invite others to experience your genuine and authentic self


### Encourage **transcendence** {#encourage-transcendence}



* We choose to be in this moment
* We are matter moving through time
* We are energy 
* Help encourage others to think, experience and listen beyond their senses
* Encourage being present and aware


### Be **creative** {#be-creative}



* Consider the causes of the situation; understanding **why** and **how **something happened/is happening is an important first step to 
* Think outside of today; create with past, present and future in mind
* Challenge paradigms and solutions to be more loving
* Recognize and maintain the beauty in our work


### Support **healing** for all {#support-healing-for-all}

We believe we are all evolving humans on a journey to self-mastery and healing. That extends from Share to those we serve, their team members, partners, and to YOU. Supporting healing also means we seek to empower our common, mutual growth. It also means we set healthy boundaries for ourselves and communicate those boundaries to others. Our offer is to be mutually supportive in whatever healthy way you wish to ensure we are all always growing and learning. We encourage you to practice self-care in whatever healthy and generative way best fits you! If we can support you in your self-care in any way please let us know. We want to be a support to you to keep yourself healthy and joyful! We are open to learning and growing and welcome your support in that as well:) 


### Build and protect **trust**  {#build-and-protect-trust}

The success of our efforts relies heavily on trust. Providing space and time for humans to interact requires holding a trusted space to honor them and their sharings, and we cannot do that if we do not trust ourselves, each other and allow those we serve to share the truth of their journey to self-mastery. Trust is established and reinforced through these four pillars:



* Integrity
* Responsibility
* Forgiveness
* Compassion

We will be forgiving and compassionate, inviting experimentation, failure, learning and love as we travel, stumble, persevere and support each other on our journeys to self-mastery. We will deliver integrity in our services and interactions, setting clear requirements for quality, sharing honestly and listening with vigor. Each individual is responsible for their conduct and will own their actions and the outcome of those actions, and Share is responsible for defining and adhering all members of the collaborative to its defined morals and ethical code. 

When considering an action and how it might impact trust in a relationship, these are helpful questions to consider:



* Am I being honest with myself about how I am showing up to this situation?
* Does this action honor my truth/integrity or the integrity of the work, Share or our stakeholders?
* Am I owning my actions, past and present, that are contributing to this environment/situation? 
* Am I approaching this with compassion in the pursuit of forgiveness, understanding and love?
* Does this action support my or someone else’s journey to self-mastery?

We will create a strong foundation of trust by answering “yes” to these questions, and supporting each other to take those actions.


### When we measure results, humanize the numbers

Data can be useful and a powerful tool to inform decisions and evolve. Sometimes those decisions support love and humankind’s journey to self-mastery. There have been times when “data” was used as “truth” and the outcome was harmful or disastrous. “Data”, as we currently experience it, largely tries to represent the complex journey to self-mastery and the wonderment of existence to single or two-dimensional data points. Share recognizes that collection, use and sharing of  “data” requires careful consideration. 

When collecting, stewarding, using or sharing data, we will consider these contexts:



* Does this data humanize or dehumanize those we serve?
* What is the potential inherent bias with this data collection, interpretation and presentation?
* Why are we collecting and using this data? How and to what end?
* Will the use of this data support or hinder journeys to self-mastery?
* Are we stewarding this information securely?
* Does collection or use of this information honor privacy, anonymity and confidentiality?


### Govern and operate Share with **transparency**, **open-ness** and **representation**  {#govern-and-operate-share-with-transparency-open-ness-and-representation}

We are transparent about how we operate as a business and with you and those we collectively serve. If you desire more detail on any facet of the business aspects of Share you are invited to reach out to Shawn, and he will be glad to share with you all the details of whatever may be of interest to you!


### Identifying and addressing friction/conflict

While on a journey to self mastery and transcendence, friction and conflict may arise with ourselves, each other, those we serve and/or the rest of the world. Additionally, we may be faced with situations where the actions we take on behalf of Share Collaborative may conflict with our own personal principles or interests. We choose to address conflict and friction through our values of transparency (sharing the friction/conflict), open-ness (communicating about the friction/conflict), trust, authenticity and love.



* Where to go with questions

Here are some other ways in which conflicts of interest could arise:



* Being employed (you or a close family member) by, or acting as a consultant to, a competitor or potential competitor, supplier or contractor, regardless of the nature of the employment, while you are employed with [Company Name].
* Hiring or supervising family members or closely related persons.
* Serving as a board member for an outside commercial company or organization.
* Owning or having a substantial interest in a competitor, supplier or contractor.
* Having a personal interest, financial interest or potential gain in any [Company Name] transaction.
* Placing company business with a firm owned or controlled by a [Company Name] employee or his or her family.
* Accepting gifts, discounts, favors or services from a customer/potential customer, competitor or supplier, unless equally available to all [Company Name] employees.
